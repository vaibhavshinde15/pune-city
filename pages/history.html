    <p>
        Shaniwar wada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune, India. Built in 1732,[1] it was the seat of the <span class="bg-yellow">Peshwas of  Maratha Confederacy</span> until 1818. The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.
    </p>
    <p>
        By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort. In 1773, Narayanrao, who was the fifth and ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by guards on orders of his uncle Raghunathrao and aunt Anandibai. A popular legend has it that Narayanrao's ghost still calls for help on full moon nights. Various people, working around the area, have allegedly reported the cries of "Kaka mala vachava" (Uncle, save me) by Narayanrao Peshwa after his death. The book, <span class="bg-yellow">Assassination of the Peshwa,</span> written in English and Marathi, covers this incident in detail.

    <p>
        Rajgad (literal meaning ruling fort) is a Hill region fort situated in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Formerly known as Murumbdev, the fort was the first capital of the Maratha Empire under the rule of <span class="bg-yellow">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</span> for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the Raigad Fort.[1] Treasures discovered from an adjacent fort called<span class="bg-yellow"> Torna</span> were used to completely build and fortify the Rajgad Fort.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Rajgad Fort is located around 60 km (37 mi) to the south-west of Pune and about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of <span class="bg-yellow">Nasrapur</span> in the <span class="bg-yellow">Sahyadris</span> range. The fort lies 1,376 m (4,514 ft) above the sea level. The diameter of the base of the fort was about 40 km (25 mi) which made it difficult to lay siege on it, which added to its strategic value. The fort's ruins consist of palaces, water cisterns, and caves. This fort was built on a hill called <span class="bg-yellow">Murumbadevi Dongar</span> (mountain of the goddess Murumba). Rajgad boasts of the highest number of days stayed by Shivaji on any fort.
